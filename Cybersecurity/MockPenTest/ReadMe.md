# Mock Penetration Test Report - Costco Wholesale Corporation

**Note:** This penetration test was conducted within the **Hack The Box** environment using simulated networks and machines. No actual Costco Wholesale Corporation networks were used or accessed during this project. The references to "Costco" in this report are for educational purposes only and do not reflect real-world penetration tests or vulnerabilities related to Costco's systems.

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive penetration test of Costco Wholesale Corporation's network. The objective of the test was to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within the network infrastructure. This report outlines the methodology, findings, and remediation recommendations for the vulnerabilities discovered.

## Methodology
The penetration testing followed a six-phase approach:
1. **Planning and Reconnaissance**: Gathering public and internal information about the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Scanning**: Utilizing tools such as Nmap and Nessus to map the network and detect vulnerable services.
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system.
4. **Maintaining Access & Privilege Escalation**: Attempting to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges to increase control.
5. **Analysis and Reporting**: Documenting findings, assessing potential impacts, and providing remediation strategies.
6. **Reporting and Remediation**: Delivering the results to stakeholders and offering detailed remediation suggestions.

## Key Findings
The penetration test revealed several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities within Costco's network, including:
- **VSFTP 2.3.4**: Vulnerable version allowing unauthorized access.
- **distccd v1**: Exploitable for remote code execution.
- **Rejetto HTTP File Server**: Vulnerable to remote code execution.
- **Bash - ‘Shellshock’**: Discovered during a scan, exploitable via web services.
- **Weak Password Policies**: Many systems were protected by weak or easily crackable passwords.

### Vulnerable Machines
- **Metasploitable 2**: Several services found to be outdated and vulnerable.
- **Optimum**: HTTP File Server 2.3 exposed to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **SickOS**: Bash 'Shellshock' vulnerability allowed root access through a reverse shell.

## Remediation Recommendations
1. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems, such as VSFTP and distccd, are updated to secure versions.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Implement stricter segmentation policies to prevent lateral movement within the network.
3. **Password Policy**: Enforce stronger password requirements and ensure the use of hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
4. **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Remove or disable non-essential services like Telnet and outdated FTP servers.
5. **Apply Security Best Practices**: Strengthen firewalls, enforce least-privilege access, and implement Zero Trust architecture.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and service detection.
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities.
- **John the Ripper**: Password cracking.

## Conclusion
This penetration test successfully identified critical security gaps within Costco’s network. Immediate action is recommended to update vulnerable systems, enhance password policies, and implement robust network segmentation. Addressing these vulnerabilities will improve Costco's overall security posture and reduce the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.
